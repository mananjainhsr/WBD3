            Hi, my name is Korukonda Viswaraj (He/Him), I was born in
            Rajahmundry: a picturesque city on the banks of River Godavari
            situated in Andhra Pradesh and I grew up in Chennai, I am currently
            studying at the
            <b>Indian Institute of Management, Rohtak </b> pursuing the 5-year
            Integrated Programme in Management. I am presently the co-cordinator
            of Vedin, the academic club at the institute. As academics highly
            interest me, I am always fascinated by the world of finance and the
            money theories. The complex web of money being theorized is a piece
            of art and it has to be savoured. I also love the Indian mythology
            and the underlying thinking fascinates me and motivates me to be a
            scientific, rational thinker.

        by nature and it helped me develop such hobbies where i keep discovering
        new things from time to time.

        <dd>
          Since my early age, I was thrilled by the sporting world and I
          actively follow Cricket, Tennis, Football, F1, Badminton and the
          Olympics. I also play Cricket, Tennis, Football and Badminton during
          leisure time

        <dt><strong> Quzzing </strong></dt>
        <dd>
          Quzzing provides an oppurtunity to learn new things daily and also
          helps to puzzle my brain to think out of the box. I have also been to
          the regional finals of TATA Crucible which was streamed on YouTube
          also.

        <br />

        <dt><strong> Coding </strong></dt>
        <dd>
          Coding helps me to break complex problems into smaller simpler
          problems and solve them with much ease, the same principle applied to
          life also makes life much merrier. During my school days, I developed
          a Stock Market Trading system using Java and MySQL.
